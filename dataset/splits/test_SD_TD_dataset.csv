Here is the story of these two cats: A lady found a pretty white cat in garbage box, She knows the owner and she talked to the cat owner about the cat but they refuse to take the cat home and they said they don't want the cat anymore. She brought the cat home and washed her and fed her but the lady knows she can not keep the cat for long because she is working more than 14 hours per day and nobody is taking care of the cat when she is not home and also she doesn't have a heart to throw out the cat and she thought maybe she can find a nice owner for this beautiful cat. But it was not the end, one week later she found another small kitten in a plastic bag, again in the garbage. She brought the cute little kitten home. Now, It is nearly impossible to take care of two cat, she desperately asking for help. They need their forever home. please help to find these two adorable cats forever and loving home.

I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them.

Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life.",cb5ecf136,4,2

He crouched on the fast lane of the road near Kepong Central Station. I was on the second lane when I noticed a car at halt and hestitated to move. The road around 6pm - 7pm was very busy. Then I was astonished when I saw this little fellow there and the driver was trying to avoid it. Since the traffic was heavy and my second lane was also at halt, I went out and try to pick the fellow up. Well for all you know God was kind and as the little fellow started crawling under the car, the driver moved slowly. Other cars that followed also slowed down to see what was happening.As I neared the fellow it ran to the side of the divider and to the pavement. Luckily for this divider there was a big piece of land (pavement). Seeing that he was safe for a moment, I went back to my car and drove slightly up as I was blocking the traffic. Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain. Oh! dear I thought, every where was covered up except this part and in he went. I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him. All the while I was praying to GOD to help and my prayer was answered. Thank You GOD Very smart fellow,tries to communicate to you.",59097271b,11,3

She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back.

Serious adopters please contact me. ***Priority will be given to those that want to adopt both. Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he canât find him, heâll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). Heâs a morning cat â will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes â Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. Heâs the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper â can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on â handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but heâs got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. Theyâre both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as Iâll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one. Call or SMS me at if youâre interested.",7a7835503,7,4

I discovered them pretty much the day they were born and have been taking care of all of them indoors. All three kittens are male with distinct personalities developing. They have lovely markings on their coat. They haven't been weaned yet but will be ready for adoption by the 15th of July. I am slowly transitioning them to solid food and mummy cat and I are litter training them. Mummy cat is very affectionate and will love to sit by you and be scratched. She will make a really lovely companion for someone. She has settled in quite comfortably so I foresee she will adapt quite easily. She is quite a young mother, no more than 2 years old. She also seems friendly towards other cats (my two cats are not the friendly type hence she needs to be adopted). My request would be for potential adopters to neuter/spay the kittens (once of suitable age) and mummy cat so that we don't end up with more strays on our streets.

They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies â¥",c2aeb6a1f,20,1

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5,2

So we need a terrace house adopter as we believed Neyo loves large spaces and it is better if new adopter have no cat/cool and calm cat at home. Please call. Kindly no SMS.

Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury.

I found them in a park where one of them the forehead was injured by cigarette burn, another one's leg was injured the same - 4 burned mark on it. They were torture seriously by the people around coz they have no owner to take care of them. I've taken them to the clinic and they have recovered from it. They are dewormed and vaccinated first jab. I've been taking care of 8 stray dogs including these two, yet I have to work on day time. It has caused me serious tension and gastric.

They will be having fresh cooked tuna or tenggiri once a week. Body weight is 8.KG (Boy) & 7.KG (Girl). This weight is taken 1 1/2 hour ago before i create this post. For adopter information :- 1) I'm not selling pet - Both of them was given to me by a friend from New Zealand. Yes, im not buying it but the cost from New Zealand to Sarawak is more than Eur1k. 2)Why i charged for both of them? if someone couldn't afford to pay adoption fee then how my cat can live in good environment with new owner? 3)I will show you all certification about both of them. I will hold all documentation about cert/import document/certification document etc. unless you show me how are they for 3-4 months. If i can see they in good hand then i will release all document to new owner. If you ask why? I think everyone know the answer well. Now lets talk about reason : 1)My wife having our 2nd baby and always complaining about not feeling well. Including vomitting when smelling thier dry foods. 2)I tried to get relative's to handle them but most of them have aggressives guard and indoor dogs. 3)My cat never caged. Only in carrier or veterinary hospital for checkup. Thats the reason i couldn't send them to boarding till my wife give birth. That's it.. For Muslim's adopter do not feel worried about my cat. They tooked dry food only. Suppliment also halal product. Wet food once a week gm each of them is plain fresh fish without any ingredient or even fish bone. Giving together all 4 tiers cat tree/bed/pet food/grooming equiptment/shampoo/dry cleaner shampoo/accessories etc. Pet food can last 2-3 months. Warning : No seperate adoption. If not willing to take both then forget it i wont letgo seperately. Thanks..",8a1e12a30,11,4

He barks along with the pack whenever strangers come to our gate. He is active and trainable. He has learned to poo and pee on the same spot, calling us whenever he needs to do his business when he's locked up in his cage. He is learning to chew only on the 'rag doll' we made for him. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, and he behaved very well at the vet clinic. He doesn't have motion sickness; he was sleek clean in the 1+ hr car ride to the clinic. Overall, he is a quiet, happy, intelligent and brave young chap. Although we have grown fond of Caleb, we would really love to see him living with a loving family.

We are just guessing that she have GSD mix from her long nose and big ears, also maybe lil Husky mix because of her fluffy husky-like tail and the rest we will have to continue guessing. Treats and food are her favs. hahah! Extremely affectionate. Love attention. Literally toilet trained. If leave outdoor, she does her business on grass. If indoor, she will do it in the toilet. She is in need of a forever home urgently. Message me now for more details. Vaccinated once. Adopter must agree to spay & continue her vaccination. Also no leashing her up or cage for long hours . She never live in a cage, because we do not practice caging them, So she might not be use to it. Only for landed house adopter. For SERIOUS DOG LOVERS or OWNERS.",95636a0d9,11,1

She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced.

Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, thatâs how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when Iâll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, Iâm able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but Iâll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie).

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5,2

Loves car rides, will jump in to the car and sit quietly to enjoy the scenery. Loves to play fetch in the garden and enjoys long walks. He sheds due to the heat and will need daily brushing. He is NOT a watchdog as he doesn't bark at strangers. No tying up or caging. Requirements: Preferably a family who can keep him indoors. Must take him for daily walks. Has a yard for him to exercise in. Keep him indoors on hot days and at night. It will be good if you have a dog as a companion for him, but he is also ok as a single dog. If interested, call or sms: introduce yourself, where you stay and if you have any dogs. FYI: adopter will have to pay his neutering and medical fee as well as food cost at foster home.

Flan Flan is the only female of the three kittens. We think that sheâll grow up to look like her very pretty mum, who has similar markings and color, but only darker. She has a kink at the beginning of her tail, weâre not sure how she got it, but she can look quite funny especially when sheâs alert or playing. Am looking for a good family who will spay her and care for her. Please watsapp me at or email me at if you are interested. Thanks!",2514503e7,11,2

We can arrange a meet-up somewhere public so you can meet her in advance before deciding. Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.",40501d365,1,3

Currently she is having heavy hairfall. bought to the UPM vet and the vet said its not fungus o kurap. she is like that because of change of diet and lack of vitamins. Now she is under the multi-coat vitamins and Omega 3 cat food The SPCA lady told us the person brought her in said he found her with her male partner. i dont know if its true or not because she is heavy, healthy and very gorgeous cat.(rare to see stray cats look like this plus she comes in with her partner). the color and everything just like the burmese cat BUT miss Jensen's tail is 3/4 long meanwhile her partner have full length tail and shinning coat and he has been adopted (bless that family). Both are super gorgeous ;). We call her Ms Jensen or Ms Heels because of her nails that sticking out of her paws and everytime she runs, we can hear this 'tuk tuk tuk' sound. like a lady running in heels! so funny her.

Therefore, her new family need to patient with her and show lots of love. Please contact me if you wish to adopt and give either of these a home.Thanks!",b00d0fe1c,3,2

(Calls will not be entertained as we do have jobs) if you are interested to ADOPT THE TWO PUPPIES TOGETHER. Do not message purely to ask if they are still available because if they have been adopted, we will update the status to Adopted. Do not contact us to adopt on behalf of someone else. You will not be entertained. Please read the following T&Cs for adoption before you contact us: Terms and Conditions: 1. Tell us why you would be the perfect adopter, and your experience with dogs, if you have any dogs currently, if you live in a landed property, and if everyone in the family is in agreement to adopt the puppies. 2. Must be treated as a member of the family and not as guard dogs. 3. Preferably kept indoors, but outdoors is fine as long as there is sufficient shelter from the heat and rain. 4. Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9. MUST allow us to visit the pups twice after adoption - we will not impose on you and your family unnecessarily, and send us picture/video updates from time to time. 10. MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable! We hope that you can find it in your hearts to give these two rascals a good and loving home!",42fc9a244,8,2

When editing her profile, I was drinking black coffee, so I gave her this name, ha..ha.. Black Coffee 2 is a 2 months old female kitten. She has silky, black, medium hair but her hair is not so thick. She has a straight, long tail & sexy lime colour eyes. She has the smallest size among the siblings. She is a bit shy and will always let other sisters eat first, she eats later. She is eating wet food (canned fish) mix with kibbles now. She has her flea treatment done & was de-wormed today, 27th May . She is healthy but not so playful. She enjoys looking other kittens play and she will just sit quietly watching at a side. Her movement is very gentle, so she is very suitable to be an indoor pet. She is under toilet (potty) training now and could be let go at anytime. *RM 50 adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery is done.

She's old therefore it's very important that she gets love, good care and attention from her new owner. It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious.

Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well. I do not want Puma to end up abandoned in some place because the adopter can't be responsible enough. Please take good care of Puma.",9e2039291,8,1

I discovered them pretty much the day they were born and have been taking care of all of them indoors. All three kittens are male with distinct personalities developing. They have lovely markings on their coat. They haven't been weaned yet but will be ready for adoption by the 15th of July. I am slowly transitioning them to solid food and mummy cat and I are litter training them. Mummy cat is very affectionate and will love to sit by you and be scratched. She will make a really lovely companion for someone. She has settled in quite comfortably so I foresee she will adapt quite easily. She is quite a young mother, no more than 2 years old. She also seems friendly towards other cats (my two cats are not the friendly type hence she needs to be adopted). My request would be for potential adopters to neuter/spay the kittens (once of suitable age) and mummy cat so that we don't end up with more strays on our streets.

Thatâs because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldnât get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now Iâm neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. Iâm now about 6 months old, but it seems I wonât be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. Itâs okay, I donât mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because Iâve been so lucky to be saved, Iâm full of glee and energy. You should see me run â Iâm fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch â well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now Iâm getting too big for it! And Iâm not a big eater, so Iâm pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy canât keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I canât. So I hope to have a loving home to go to â where I can bring life, joy and glee to my new family. I hope we meet soon!",2b38b60d2,2,3

However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

My parents always wanted me to put them up for adoption as I already own 3 dogs and I will be leaving to Overseas to further my studies. However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the ""Lion King"" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the ""stranger"". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent. Both of them are the perfect family dogs and they can guard the house pretty well. #FunFacts about them that make them adorable: 1. They are afraid of fireworks. 2. They are always wag their tails when you are home! 3. They love being pet and never get sick of being complimented. 4. Just simply because they are super ADORABLE AND LOVABLE!",c634af483,5,4

She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you. Nini",47a142b50,13,3

They weren't abandoned by their parents. It's just that being canine, unlicensed ones, their parents were captured by MBSA two years ago. Since then, residents of have been taking care of them by feeding and sheltering them whenever possible. As they are females, they have all been neutered (at 9 months old) to ensure unsolicited attention from other male canines. Bobby (a female but named such), in human being's term, is like an autistic child. She was traumatised by her parents' abduction at an early age and is extremely afraid of human. She is very attached to Nike (the male Alsation, living in the first house, two doors away). It's extremely difficult to capture her, even MBSA has failed many times. Clever, as she was taken away from her mum at birth(someone adopted her and didn't want her after a few months) and was whining and pining for her for the initial few weeks..... she is pretty hyper, short fused and likes to chase cars.... and strangers.... so I am terribly if anyone here has been chased or barked by her. However, her bark is worse than her bite, just give her a shout and fierce look,she will run off....... She is a very good watch dog though..... and very obediently comes back to the house after she has done her share of running for the night. She doesn't eat much but more frequent than usual (three small portion), not choosy about her food and she's fine with water. She isn't the lovey dovey type though. As for Hong Hong, she is definitely the prima donna type. Loves to be cuddled, will know how to win back your heart after being naughty. She will look at you with her almond shaped eyes and lift her paws and rest them on you...... She's awfully afraid of thunder and will hide behind you or try to get into the house whenever it rains cats and dogs. She hates water and chooses food) For months now, i have kept Clever and Hong Hong in my house. Sometimes they do escaped but they will still head home for food. Bobby, she's outside, she has been taking care of herself. I just feed her dinner every evening. Actually, the three of them are part of a litter of 8. We have managed to get the rest adopted..... It is with a heavy heart that i have to put Clever and Hong Hong up for adoption. One of the main reasons is, my son and I are acute bronchitis sufferers and having dogs in our compound aren't helping with our condition. Secondly, i am having some muslim students coming to my house for classes next year and it is not convenient for the dogs to be around....... Hong Hong can be a really good companion dog and Clever, a good watch dog..... If you know of anyone who is looking for such dogs, please let me know.... my contact no is. Only serious inquiries will be entertained. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BTW, April, one of their siblings, is staying at one of the neighbour's house along too..... so actually is a doggy's lane..... most of us love dogs, and because of them, we are a closely knitted neighbourhood..... we know each other well and watch out for one another..... Hope adopting Hong Hong or Clever will bring such atmosphere to your neighbourhood too.... Cheers..... I am up by one now coz a neighbour who initially taken one of the female pups have decided not to keep the pups......",379d5e10d,1,4

She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period. She is such a fighter against all odds despite the serious injury at such an early tender age of her life. She is growing up to be a beautiful and loving girl. Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13). As such, we are seeking kind adopter to give Blessed a chance to have a loving home immediately after having just a hard life on the street. Please call/sms WM Cheong ( )",23b3f793e,2,4

I have been keeping her for 3 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Molly, she is 3yr, female, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!",748943e29,5,2

She sleeps most of the day and will call for you when she's hungry or just wants love. She has a slight luxating patella but it does not bother her. She's the friendliest girl and gets along with anyone or anything really. She is litter trained. When I go for walks out of the house Yeni tends to follow. She's not the sharpest cat but she is definitely a sweet girl. Lynn is a very shy girl with beautiful shiny soft coat. She takes some time to warm up to new people but once she gets to know you she will always come for love. Lynn is very adventurous thus likes to wander around. She is very intelligent and talkative. Once she is close to you she will answer you with a meow every time you call or say anything to her. She does her business outside of the house. Both come when called. Please take note that these cats are very close to me because of the amount of time i spend with them. If you wish to have the same results you need to spend quality time with them too. :D If interested in adopting Yeni or Lynn alone please drop me a msg and we can discuss it further. The RM adoption fee is just a precaution. I will ask you a series of questions to make sure that you are fit to take care of them. If I find that you may potentially be excellent new owners, I may waive the adoption fee. I'm putting them up for adoption as I will be migrating in the near future. I wish I could take them with me but I can't. So I hope to find good homes for them. UPDATE: (/11)Gugu already has an adopter. Now Lynn and Yeni need to find a good home too. :)",7a12e98d8,6,4

For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 7) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter.

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada.

In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us.

Please give us a permanent loving home, and we promised to return your love. Thank you very much for adopting me. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",cd2451ab4,7,3

I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!! But I don't mind, I'd much rather stay at home with my new family than roam the streets and get beaten up all the time. So if you want me to love you all you have to do is call Chica's Mum .... and please hurry ... I want to love you very much, very soon.",f14c5a335,1,4

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy.

I found 2 kittens (Male & Female) that need a new home because I am flying soon and there is nobody is able to take care of them. If there's anyone willing to adopt and take good care of them please whatsapp me at. Details of Female: The female kitten is very playful despite she is a disable kitten. She is blind as we had to take out her left eyes due to infection and prevent any damages to her eyes. She had an operation and slowly is healing now. She finished all her medicines and is very healthy now. Her right eyes is blurry but still able to see. She is a disable cat and a special care is required. For now i just locked her inside the cage with her buddy and let them play outside in the evening with supervision. Potty trained and eats alot. She is not very friendly at first because she cant see whats around her, but slowly allow herself to adapt with human. Details of Male: The male is super playful and friendly and loves attention from people. Potty trained and eats alot too. Adoption is only to people who don't have any cats at home or people who can really take good care of them especially the female as she needs a special care due to her disabilities. They are very easy to take care of, we just don't have the time to do it so we hope somebody can take good care of them Preferably take both home because they are so attached and comfortable to each other. To anyone who is willing to give them care & affection, can contact me via WhatsApp / Call / Message . Pick up in Subang Jaya or somewhere nearby. Thank you.",38abad64b,5,2

The most remarkable thing about him is his very sweet and beautiful face. What makes him more special though is that his personality mirrors his face: he is sweet, gentle and affectionate (manja). He will rush after you to play and be stroked and cuddled. He is very well-trained with cat litter and is a good and obedient cat (not overly playful or boisterous). He will grow up to be a very handsome and large cat (following his persian side) because even now he is bigger than most domestic kittens his age. I hope to find him a good, loving home with people who will love him and can give him good quality cat food and chicken meat (his favourite :)as well as the ability to afford a vet visit if neccessary. Pls note: I must be honest and emphasize that he is a very fussy eater. He doesn't like cat biscuits and will only eat canned food if mixed with boiled chicken or fish meat. And not given the food he likes he will hardly eat and grow thin. He also has a sensitive stomach and if not given quality food (that means no table scraps) he will have diarrhoe. Despite all this his beauty, his playfulness and his very affectionate personality makes me hard to part with him but if you feel you can give him a better home...pls contact me. The money you pay for him is not for me to profit but will go a long way to help the other cats under my care.",ee24b09bb,5,3

The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but itÂ´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But itâs not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them. If you have any problems in keeping them, you can return them to us immediately, no questions asked. If it is important to you, the cats stay in a ""halal"" household.

She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food. She survived after eating 12 chocolates! One hell of a tough dog I must say. I'm running out of time, really desperate for an adopter. I really do not wish to put her back on the street.

Been looking out after them and they have been nursed healthily by mother cat. Tonight, I separated them from mother cat in preparation for adoption. They have each been scrubbed clean ears to paws. A few fleas removed by shampoo/total wash down and ears are free of mites. Ear mite drops administered and eye cream applied to each cos they have been running and hiding in rain gutters in the back alley, so a bit of precaution since I'm taking them into my home with my own two cats. Tame cos I've been playing with them to let them get used to human contact. A bit shy at first but goes soft and lazy when you give them a good cuddle. Very very healthy and will make good pets. Litter trained in the backyard and feeding on kibbles and able to drink from water bowl. I would prefer them to be adopted as a pair, and the other with an owner who already owns a cat or kitten. Or better still, all three one go! :D Please text or email to me and I'll reply to arrange for viewing.

But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up.

Seeing the deplorable condition the puppy is living in (lying around the floor with spilled engine oil, water container contaminated with all sorts of automobile oil and God knows if he's been fed properly), the car owner decided to probe a bit further into how he's been treated all this while. According to some folks around that area, Bear Bear used to have 3 other siblings but Bear Bear is the only one left as the other three were run down by cars which came to the workshop to get their cars fixed. Bear Bear has been brought to the vet for a checkup and blood test. Blood test results show that he's fighting some form of infection and is currently on a course of antibiotics. He has also got cherry eyes (the large red mass bulging out of the inner corner of his eyes. those are actually his own tear glands which popped out) . Anyone who knows about cherry eyes will know that it's a condition which is not visually appealing, but fairly common (especially in certain breeds, Shar Pei is one of them) . However it's actually benign (non life threatening) and can be corrected via surgery. Bear Bear is currently under observation and boarding at the vet's clinic. If all goes well, he would be vaccinated in a couple of days. Since the cherry eye condition is non life threatening, priority is given towards treating his infection. Bear Bear is very friendly towards humans and quiet (not whiny, and exudes a calm personality) We are currently appealing for anyone who can help foster him till he recovers from infection and ready for adoption. Kindly drop us a note at if you could foster Bear Bear whilst we work on getting him rehomed. Please contact Mun Ee for more info =) www.facebook.com/PawsMission",4b4bb2b0a,5,4

While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption.

We knew the possibility to find them back is slim as they were dognapped, not lost. After few months, we adopted a mongrel whom originally was our neighbour's dog. He was beaten every night until he became our dog. Few months back, we saw a lost&found picture of our huskies on facebook. They were dumped in Ampang, therefore we went and picked them back. It was a miracle, couldn't be more happy. When we brought them back, the huskies cannot get along with my mongrel, they were very tensed.

I wish to seek for someone who can adopt both of my huskies together (1 male & 1 female), they has been very attached to each other all these year.

We have to say that Jacker is a real smart boy - an abandoned Jack Russell who ran into our home compound one morning and tapped at our glass door to seek help! We took him in and found that he was dirty, having bad skin condition and emaciated. It was believed that he had been loitering on street for a long period. After sent him to vet clinic we found that he actually had microchip which showed the details of his 1st owner. His 1st owner told us that he've ""sold"" Jacker to one of his friend and after he contacted that friend who's the 2nd owner, he said Jacker actually ran out of the house and he don't want this dog anymore.(WE'RE EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HIM). The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good! Jacker is a completely different boy now after staying with us for few months, he's happy, friendly with every dogs, loves to have pat on head, loves to run and walk around when he's happy, not aggressive to strangers anymore and the skin condition is fully recovered. But please note that he will still keep a distance with stranger, get a bit frightened if you've have big action and he do urine marking in house. Interested to adopt?

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",835fdb873,9,1

One has discharge in its eyes (which we have been constantly cleaning every time the eyes start to form the discharge) and the other is the smallest and weakest among all the kittens, is blind on its left eye and has a tough time consuming any food. I won't be in Malaysia around the mid of next month, as I am going overseas to further my studies, so I hope someone could accommodate at least one; or if possible, the whole lot. UPDATE: We've sent them to the vet for a basic check up and they happen to have caught a mild flu. But the doctor gave us some antibiotics and eye drops (for the one with discharge). They are also dewormed and the vet did a random heart worm check on one of the kittens and it came back negative.

Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.",950dd345b,6,3

We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems.

Too sad. They were rescued at one month plus by a kind lady who brought them to me in two batches and now being fostered at my house. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made my two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life.",cb5ecf136,4,2

The plan was to raise them to be big and strong enough to be individually adopted. They are now big enough and it is becoming very difficult for me to continue handling all of them. They are all in good health and are very lively and adorable. Do take a look at some of their pictures and I hope you would at least fall in love with one. I did bring them fir deworming once but was advised to bring them for a second time. I however do not have the transport and resources to do so. All the kittens have been weaned from milk and can eat kibbles. Except for the one with the pink nose. She is a little small a requires a bit more attention when feeding. Further info will be provided if interested. Kittens are litter box trained. Still a little messy but will improve with time and age.,006ffebaf,5,2

We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter.
