Posie is a sweet heart that has a beautiful smile. Meet Posie, The Super Posery. Posie was found near a POS Malaysia post office and the day she was found is the day, she decided to pose. She may have been abandoned or even, left there to fend for herself. Either way, we don't know her history. Posie is a bit timid but she is also very friendly. Posie loves to play! She gets along with all dogs and love to play with them. Posie even loves one-to-one play sessions with another dog (the breed is of no issue). She likes to jump! Just throw a stick up in air and she will leap and catch it! Great fun! Right now, all Posie needs is a home and family. She deserves to be happy and you will be happy once you get to know or love her. Please provide a loving home for her as she will make you a very happy person. Ps. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure she is taken care off. Pss.

I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe?

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",8f1bdc253,2,2

Later that nite I went back to see if the mother came back. There's no sign the mother was with them and if I think back the box is damn small doesn't seems to fit in the mother so I came to a conclusion they were not dumped with the mother so I took them.

My brother and I found this adventurous little boycat yesterday stuck in the engine of a motorbike at the Section 17 night hawker centre. We fished him out and cleaned him up, and he's turned out to be a really adorable, friendly, fun five-week-old (estimated) who loves to cuddle people and sleep with or on top of them. He has an almost all black coat with what looks like white or grey ""highlights"" of stripes on his head and chest. Even as I'm typing this right now, he's curled up in my lap. Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today. Sadly I can't keep him because my parents won't let me, but PAWS and ASPCA and other sanctuaries I've tried appear to be full up. I'd rather not put him back on the street, though, so if you would like to or you know anyone who'd like to take him into your home, please send me a message! Thanks. I'm willing to help cover the cost of his adoption (vaccinations, neutering etc) if you would need help with it. If you don't intend to neuter him, I'm afraid that he cannot go with you.

She's not the sharpest cat but she is definitely a sweet girl. Lynn is a very shy girl with beautiful shiny soft coat. She takes some time to warm up to new people but once she gets to know you she will always come for love. Lynn is very adventurous thus likes to wander around. She is very intelligent and talkative. Once she is close to you she will answer you with a meow every time you call or say anything to her. She does her business outside of the house. Both come when called. Please take note that these cats are very close to me because of the amount of time i spend with them. If you wish to have the same results you need to spend quality time with them too. :D If interested in adopting Yeni or Lynn alone please drop me a msg and we can discuss it further. The RM adoption fee is just a precaution. I will ask you a series of questions to make sure that you are fit to take care of them. If I find that you may potentially be excellent new owners, I may waive the adoption fee. I'm putting them up for adoption as I will be migrating in the near future.

We adopted him from a breeder (in other worda bought him) and have been taking care of him since he is 4 months old. He's been completely vaccinated (incl feline-leukemia), dewormed and spayed. Aboo is a house-cat but is allowed to go out once in a while. He's litter trained and very adaptable to the type of litter used (clumping clay, crystal, Okoplus). Food wise, he's not at all a picky eater but we feed him with either Royal Canin or LV fit 31. We send him for grooming every fortnight and I myself had groomed him once in a while and he enjoys getting baths. However, my family and I are relocating overseas so the documentation works and processes is so much of an effort to bring Aboo along so, sadly, we have to let him stay. Hopefully any of you kind souls out there who are willing to adopt Aboo, please contact me at soon. I will provide you his health card to show his vaccination dates and will also let go of the cage and all Aboo's belonging (cage, automatic drink dispenser, stainless steel food bowl, litter box, combs and brush and etc etc)if you agree to adopt him. The price RM quoted is merely for the expenses of his vaccination and the things we included together with Aboo. Feel free to whatsapp/call/SMS.",4a874872c,0,4

He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. â¥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",183eb3fe5,14,3

She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",63d254530,22,3

We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: Iâm Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummyâs friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummyâs care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldnât stay too long at foster mummyâs house mainly it was because I couldnât get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummyâs cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummyâs ( now ex-foster mummy) grandmaâs house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says Iâm overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DONâT do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily. I have thunder/fireworks Phobia! kindly contact me through facebook PM",1fba9cbc9,4,4

The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon.

The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated.

We brought him to a vet and cared for him until he returned to full health, and his head injuries has recovered. Now he is a very active and playful puppy, always ready for a game with a human companion. His favourite hour of the day is during feeding time. He can be overly excited when a treat is presented to him. He's currently being boarded at a temporary shelter (Second Chance Animal Society) Langat (off Batu 9, Cheras). Please consider adopting this lovable and handsome guy! we named him Luke, because the force is strong with this one. :) If interested, please contact Ms. Eivonne at",6d67ee4d1,16,3

This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

Yesterday night we met Bambi. She ran out from the roadside very quickly to the middle of the road and our car nearly hit her. She's a super beautiful tiger striped girl with innocent big round eyes. Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period. We feel that Bambi is more suitable to keep indoor at this point since she don't pee and poo anywhere and loves to have companion... Interested to adopt?

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality.

Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size.

Drive to Pusat Kurungan Haiwan Lebuh Sultan Muhammad Kawasan Perindustrian Bandar Sultan Sulaiman Pelabuhan Klang Tel : (For Sat & Sun, opening hours are 8am - 12pm) 2.

Please be compassionate. Put yourself in their shoes: locked inside knowing its over. THEY DO KNOW. 5. I have seen them wasted much close to D days. Don't tell me they didn't undergo heightened enxiety & despair in anticipation of the end. What's worse their owners never came for them.

My friend saw and rescused the dog. My friend then approached me to foster Coco (to nurse him back to health).

She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food â Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat â washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter â Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÃkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter â a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter â a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open doorâ policy â Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5,26,3

You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection.

She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten. Thanks for your time to read through! ....I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine.",51f1d14b6,18,3

Caesar is up for adoption as the owner is currently suffering from back injury and could not spend enough time to bring her out for walks and see to her needs. Caesar will be spayed and the adoption fee of RM is to cover for spaying fee, blood test, general check up. She is currently on tick prevention & heart worm prevention (Feb & Mar ). Caesar is NOT a guard dog. She does bark at strangers at the gate occasionally. She's friendly and is very energetic. She plays with anyone. She loves charging and jumping (which may not be suitable for households with small kids - unless with strict supervision and discipline). Caesar is still a puppy, without proper exercise, she is rather destructive (she chews slippers, auto gate cable, car bumper when left unsupervised). With sufficient exercise, she maintains a clean record for the past 3 weeks with us (she did not destroy anything at all). If you are willing to provide her with a good home, please contact me by leaving me a message. We prefer to re-home her to a new home within Klang Valley. Please describe: (1) Your experience with dogs (if any) (2) The environment you intend to provide her with (no cage, no unnecessary tie-up) (3) Please state if you agree to a 1-month trial in which we will visit once or twice to see if it is a good match Please note that those who do not describe the 3 key points will not get a reply from us.

We found these cats in our front yard (we put cat food in front yard for strays), about two weeks ago. These poor kittens had their whiskers cut (Apparently there are people who believe that cutting cat's whiskers will make them unable to come back - poor these kittens! That is just animal cruelty!) When we found them, they were so hungry and so slim their backbone shows! They are now perfectly healthy and active. We already brought them to the vet clinic and have them dewormed and deflea and the doctor said they were 1 and a half months old. They are still too young for vaccination though. These two loves to play and very spoiled. They are litter-trained and can already eat dry food. One of them is male - white coloured with black spots on his head and black tail. The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail. They need to be resheltered as we already have 4 cats they get in a fight so much we have to put these two in the cage at all times to avoid injuries.

I was hoping to keep her, but my 19 year old cat is too stressed out with a kitten in the house. She is black and white with a smudge of white on one side of her nose and a smudge of black under her chin. She has 3 full white socks and one foot with white toes. She has the tiniest little hook at the end of her long tail. She is very healthy and is eating wet and dry food, and is litter box trained. She was one of the smallest kittens in a litter of 6 that were abandoned near my home last month. I just want to let you know that she has a slightly deformed sternum that is already starting to settle down as she is growing. For this reason, she needs more gentle care when lifting and she may incur some vet bills later to find out how this affects her diaphragm and organs.....if at all. I am willing to assist with vet bills. If you come to meet Smudges, you will see that it does NOT affect her racing around, pouncing, climbing or playing one little bit! She is a very active and lively little girl! I hope to find someone who will love her like I do! She really is a sweetheart!",7a496733d,2,3

The car was about to reverse and run over her when we spotted her and ran to stop the car from moving. We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life. She loves to play and snuggle with you on the floor and is still the same happy go lucky girl she always was, always ready to greet you with a smile and a tail wag. She's very quite and friendly to people and animals alike. She's now looking for a home where she can grow into a well loved pup! If interested PLEASE do give us a call or email us.

Not sure who had took all of us away from our mother, and dump us at the backlane of a shop. We were very hungry and we were almost eaten alive by surrounding stray dogs. In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us. My fosterer took care of all of us when we were 4 weeks old, from sick, tiny and boney kittens. We are now healthy, playful and active 12 weeks old kittens. We thanked our rescuer and fosterer, for they have given us a chance to live. Please adopt us, we need a permanent home, as my fosterer said we are now healthy, big enough to be cared for easily and ready to be loved. Please give us a permanent loving home, and we promised to return your love. Thank you very much for adopting me. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",cd2451ab4,7,3

With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL.",e911008b8,8,1

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",0aaf6976a,13,2

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breedersâ requests will not be entertained. Weâll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?",1528d2a61,12,2

At least one puppy was crushed to death instantly. Another fom shock & truma after its tiny limb was crushed to bits too. All are very young around 6 weeks of age.Some have stumpy tails others are long. One is cream in colour, another brown, some black & tan and the rest white with brown markings. All were infested with worms but they are cleared now AND has started putting on weigh & becomes lively as the food ate are all utilize by their very own little bodies & not goppled by nasty worms as before. They are very active and playful now & ""quarrel "" over heirarchy. They are most delightful when all are yapping away in that lovely puppy voices of theirs. 2 others joined in on the 30 Sept.The small one with bunny tail & one eye patch together with another baby whose tail was tied with rubber band ( Cruel people tried docking its tail. It didn't dropped but turned infected with sore & maggots worms !) have gone home to a granny in Seremban on 4 Sept.The other of these 2 is an Alpha.He is just 6 weeks old but he refused to stay in cages or playpen & must run with the big boys.And that he indded does & we called him Morgan. There is another smart Alexis. She Is VERY SMART. Only 6 weeks old but learned she has GREAT magical power by pushing her snout between the playpen bars & pushed. ""By Golly., I can push this fences "". She pushes the pent to & fro to the delights of her fellow buddies this way daily. Quite a sight to behold. Come, these bunch of survivors from the construction site are some characters like their human kind. Thank God, they haven't acquire their language though. 8/9/09 Latest on our Alpha 6 wks old MORGAN Yes. 6 wks old Morgan climbed into our shallow watering bowl & stood in it to cool himself down. He immerse his tiny head into the water next & swings it about before pulling his head out.He shakes the water off next. Only then, will he climds out of the tub. My goodness, he is only 6 wks old. What will he do next ? He actually tried to steal sonme of Loke's ( ahigh ranking adult male )dinner tonight. Loke snarled aggressively & pretended to nap him ;only then did he scrurried away with a scream. Never ever have I seen such alphaness in such a tiny pup before. It is must be the construction environmental factor that spured such genes. 15/9/09 4 more 1mth+ Sunways joined us on the 9/9/09.Small little bunnies they are. Infact two of them have a two inches wide darkened strip running down from its head right down to the base of its tails.Their photos would be out soon but one of the Chipmunk looking pup is already adopted by Aunty Ann & Uncle Clement.

That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack. Oh yes, he responds to this name given by me. And yes, he has no name with his previous owner. So, there you have it, I can't bring Jack Jack ""back to life"". But I hope to find a good home for him :)",b780980c1,13,3

They were born on 9th Dec . They will be up for adoption. My heart breaks to release them all. Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home.

Loves outdoor & need time bring for walk once/twice a day (love running). He pull on leash as it natural for husky. Can be train because I tried before and still need more training.

That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound. Doctor doubt that in his last treatment didn't clean his wound properly which caused a chance that there might be another maggot. It can be cure by taking oral medication as his previous maggot wound healed after few weeks time. Its a shame that owner abandon this beautiful dog and I couldn't handle 2 dogs because I have Jack Russell & small space plus my old man don't really like big dog. Can only keep him until end of this month. Hope it can find the right owner soon as I not able to keep him for long. I don't want it end up in SPCA.

Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.",40501d365,1,3

Learnt to sit in a day, wait for food in 2 days. Will poo in grass whenever possible. Excellent temperament, very manja with humans and playful with dogs. I cannot verify this but she has many markings of a Belgian Malinois and she seemed to have thick bones and might grow up to be medium sized. Had her first vaccination and deworming and is very healthy. Too young to be spayed but will subsidize cost of spaying if cost is an issue to future family.

To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and Iâm doing my best to âfeedâ them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners.

When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

She was rescued underneath an abandon car called home as her tiny head was stuck in the car's metal bar or something and she was unable to free herself. I guess she was stucked there for almost 2days or so coz after I freed her, she kinda stumble in her walk. Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 2 March . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",01ac09f2a,5,3

The last 18 NEED HOMES URGENTLY as the couple is no longer able to care for them. Due to some personal issues, and a new baby then need to move out. None of the local pet associations are willing to take them on so it is once again left up to concerned caring citizens to help out and lend a hand. THIS is an URGENT call for HELP! These cats need homes within the NEXT TWO WEEKS. Please invite ALL your friends to this event which shall be on going until all the cats are rehomed.
